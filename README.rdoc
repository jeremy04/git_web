Rails app for viewing git logs

Using rbenv (sorry RVM, I don't use it anymore)
    $ git clone https://github.com/jeremy04/git_web.git
    $ cd git_web
    $ gem install bundler
    $ bundle install
    $ rake db:migate
    $ rake db:seed

"Rake seed" does the importing of the sample git log. 50% of the code is for importing, the rest is for the UI.
Not much going on here, so unit testing is very minimal.

This was a sample project that was given during an interview.
